    <p>Implementing a solution across multiple companies can be challenging because you need to trust data from partners. In most cases, you use a central database. Data is stored in one location as the source of truth. The company who maintains the database must be trusted as the central authority of the data.
         Blockchain lets you implement a business process when you need to trust data and participants without using a central database.</p>
